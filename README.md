This dotfiles setup is heavily based on [Dries Vints' dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles). Read more about the original to get started with your own:

## Introduction

This repository holds most of the stuff I need to set up a new Mac. It makes setup much faster and less error-prone.

## A Fresh Setup

### Before you re-install

First, go through the checklist below to make sure you didn't forget anything before you wipe your hard drive.

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you remember to save all important non-cloud documents?
- Did you remember to export important data from your local database?

### Setting up your Mac

If you did all of the above you may now follow these install instructions to setup a new Mac.

1. Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store
2. [Generate a new public and private SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) by running:

   ```zsh
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stopa/dotfiles/HEAD/ssh.sh | sh -s "<your-email-address>"
   ```

3. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` and go to the directory:

    ```zsh
    git clone git@github.com:stopa/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles
    ```

4. Run the installation with:

    ```zsh
    ./fresh.sh
    ```

5. Restart your computer to finalize the process

6. Have fun logging into all the apps! Firefox and Webstorm settings are synced through respective accounts.

Your Mac is now ready to use!

> üí° You can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Make sure you also update the reference in the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc#L2) file.

## What actually happens?

1. `oh-my-zsh` is [installed](./fresh.sh#L5), if missing
2. Homebrew is [installed](./fresh.sh#L10), if missing
3. `.zshrc` from this repo is [symlinked](./fresh.sh#L18) to the system one
4. A whole bunch of tools and applications are [installed](./fresh.sh#L25) from Homebrew (see the [Brewfile](./Brewfile))
5. Defaults MySQL password is [set](./fresh.sh#L29)
6. Some useful directories are [created](./fresh.sh#L32) and a bunch of git repos [cloned](./clone.sh) into them
7. Ruby gems [installed](./fresh.sh#L41)
8. Git config from this repo is [symlinked](./fresh.sh#L44) to the system one, global gitignore is applied
9. A whole bunch of macOS settings are [set](./fresh.sh#L50) (see [.macos file](./.macos))

> ‚ùó Some of the macos defaults seem to not be working, which I'll attribute to them being semi-secret menu items anyway.
